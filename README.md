Embrace technology to be the coolest marketer

Hi there!
I am Yi from China. Photography is my hobby. It's about authenticity. Why? 
I like shooting two things, landscapes and these moments that make you resonate.
Landscapes. They are nature, things that never lie to you.
And these moments. People don't really say what they are thinking. But if you capture the right moment, it says more.
